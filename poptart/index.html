        poptart is a word that me and someone pretty close to me coined when we had to switch to "hella serious mode" from "ehhh wateva mode", and i thought it would be fitting, since this person would be likely reading this too:) so, hi pooki!! 😊 anyhow, i thought it would be fitting to explain some stuff here, real serious shi yknow.<br><br>
        <h1>this website</h1>
        this website is actually just a project started at some point because it was fun and i kind of just wanted to :) it ended up becoming hella great and in general i really love it! and its awesome, truly. anyways, all devlopment was conducted in a small european union member staet [i wont disclose the actual counrty], i do not actually condone north korea, have any political agenda, nor russia, nor do i mean to offend anyone from poland and other possible places, this website is purely for fun, and nothing is serious. basecomust.github.io is also not under my control, but the creator of it is pretty chill, so you should be okay over there :)<br><br>today is the 16th of october 2025, i would liek to say, that this website has come a very long way from where it originally started, so much so, that it is hard to probably understand or grasp the true nature of this website. and in a sense i guess i like it that way, its not supposed to be understood by everyone.<br><br>however, it would be really nice, if you took everything on this website in a nice and silly manner, dont take anything too seriously, and all jokes and everything is pure sillyness and nothing more. i do not associate myself with any politics, nor does this website exist to push any agenda, any political views, and is not meant to offend anyone in the slightest.<br><br>i will say, that you can find a lot of stuff on this website, and its all pretty personal and raw, and youre in for a pretty interesting experience i suppose. if you end up enjoying it, i am really glad. if you dont, then its kind of your problem highkey. if you get offedned or something, im... sorry? but otherwise dont go around pretending like you know everything. this website goes pretty deep into some topics, experiences, and so on.<br><br>and finally, this website is best enjoyed on a 5:3 ratio small window, because thats how i developed it, so i think it helps you experience it beter :) there are many clues and features to find and explore, have fun and good luck. :) 
        <h1>notes</h1>
