        poptart is a word that me and someone pretty close to me coined when we had to switch to "hella serious mode"
        from "ehhh wateva mode", and i thought it would be fitting, since this person would be likely reading this too:)
        so, hi pooki!! 😊 anyhow, i thought it would be fitting to explain some stuff here, real serious shi yknow...
        and uh, the following is just a very long yap about how i dont support north korea 💀<br><br>
        <h1>this website</h1>
        this website is actually just a project started at some point because it was fun and i kind of just wanted to :)
        it ended up becoming hella great and in general i really love it! and its awesome, truly. anyways, all
        devlopment was conducted in a small european union member staet [<div
                style="all:unset; text-decoration: line-through; text-decoration-thickness: 3px">i wont disclose the
                actual counrty</div>, i disclosed it anyway:D], i do not actually condone north korea, have any
        political agenda, nor russia, nor do i mean to offend anyone from poland and other possible places, this website
        is purely for fun, and nothing is serious. basecomust.github.io is also not under my control, but the creator of
        it is pretty chill, so you should be okay over there :) everything stated on the website is personal opinion,
        and should be taken with a grain of salt. this is all just for legality purposes, yk, cant afford to be sued at
        such a yung age innit fam.<br><br>also mates, please note that this website has a policy, where this site [not
        its forks, or any other variants that are not approved by katrewkate], cannot have parts or references erased
        from it, providing the authentic and "original" experience. meaning, that everything you see here and now is
        developed and only IMPROVED upon, from the first day the page/website/etc was released. this also means what
        comes on here likely stays forever. all of this does not apply to references to people who have been asked to be
        removed or such.<br><br>today is the 16th of october 2025, i would liek to say, that this website has come a
        very long way from where it originally started, so much so, that it is hard to probably understand or grasp the
        true nature of this website. and in a sense i guess i like it that way, its not supposed to be understood by
        everyone. [2025 nov edit: the website has officially become one of the longest lasting projects, and doesnt seem like it will change anytime soon, so yaaaaaay :P]<br><br>however, it would be really nice, if you took everything on this website in a nice and silly
        manner, dont take anything too seriously, and all jokes and everything is pure sillyness and nothing more. i do
        not associate myself with any politics, nor does this website exist to push any agenda, any political views, and
        is not meant to offend anyone in the slightest.<br><br>i will say, that you can find a lot of stuff on this
        website, and its all pretty personal and raw, and youre in for a pretty interesting experience i suppose. if you
        end up enjoying it, i am really glad. if you dont, then its kind of your problem highkey. if you get offedned or
        something, im... sorry? but otherwise dont go around pretending like you know everything. this website goes
        pretty deep into some topics, experiences, and so on.<br><br>and finally there are many clues and features to
        find and explore, regarding timezones and other information, all information on this website is tailored to
        LITHUANIA [albeit in english], as it would give the most realistic and authentic experience; have fun and good
        luck. :)
        <div
                style="padding: 5px; margin: 10px 0 0 0; background: rgba(136, 0, 0, 0.418); outline: 5px solid rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.452); font-size:unset; font-style: italic; line-height: 28px; line-gap-override: 0">
                this website is best enjoyed on a 5:3 ratio small window, because thats how i developed it, so i think
                it helps you experience it beter :) KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS WEBSITE IS BEST EXPERIENCED ON A WINDOWS
                SYSTEM, as it was developed on one, and there could be bugs/inconsistencies on certain elements, or some
                features are bugged or broken.<br><br>as per your data, the only data being collected would be visitor
                information (by google analytics) [such as clicks, engagement, time spent, etc], anything else such as
                ip addresses, etc will not be logged or anyhow used/processed.<br><br>as for the sponsors on the misc
                page and other people mentioned besides public figures i appreciate or find funny/interesting/wateva,
                they were offered the ability to sponsor the website free of charge, because friednz are friendz. i am
                not responsbel for the actions. sponsoring the website is not available outside of that. :)<br><br>ALSO
