                boat [also known as boat the goat, b.o.a.t, the boat of all time, boat from china, and el. at.] is the
                newest bot developed by katrewdustries inc, from its soft launch in september of 2024, boat was on the
                verge of being "abandoned" many times, but ended up being the project katrewdustires and their staff
                came back to regularly. boat continues to be a based and most advanced [and sadly, likely the last] bot
                created for platform discord. it has a bunch of nextgen features, some of which were inspired by
                globalutilities [such as the katnet, economy, and other trivial features], alongside other bots that
                katdustries developed.
                <h2>main features innit</h2>
                fully functional and totally legal, reliable and noncorrupt economy with a totally responsible ceo
                [katrekat]!<br>katnet [basic functionality and is more of a concept atm]<br>fully fledged achievement
                system<br>custom profiles, unique distinct look<br>multi-language support [natively supports four
                languages, see below], albeit has other unnecessary languages/fakeguages.<br>very legal and supervised
                casino/gamblign system. 🤑🤑🤑💰💰<br>advanced logging system with colors n shi<br>many fun
                features!<br>shop system [provided by vucicbot, see basecomust.github.io for more details!] and fun
                integration with vucicbot.
                <h2>supported languages</h2>

                <h2>technologies utilized</h2>
                boat was coded using python, visual studio code insiders [thank you, microsoft, for making something
                work well 😘😘], using libraries: pycord, utilizing .json for storage / data. also, big thanks to mr
                discord for allowing us to make epic bots on their platform, however, katdustries highly condemns adding
                features, that bots have already implemented, it is, however, understandable, for them to want to do so,
                however, they could pay more attention to botmakers and such. :) that made zero sense, ill shut up :(
                <h2>currency</h2>
                KATS [previously supposed to be "Solars"], 16 KATS:1 Vucic Social Credit, meaning that for Vucic shop,
                you need to take the social credit amount and multiply it by 16 to get the price of the item in KATS.
                Vucic currently supports KATS, and is a valid payment method. The exchange is immediate and seamless
                between bots, do not resort to third party exchanges.
                <h2>supported servers</h2>
                currently only approved servers [currently, base comust, sveicarija, bacair reserch facility] have full
                unwaivered support with no major limitations, some boat's features might be limited or unavailable
                outside of these servers. currently, membership for such servers is not on the way, nor is it ever
                planned.
                <h2>ff [funfact]</h2>
                hi sigmas. you wont believe this, but fireworks were fired on boat's 1st birthday. they werent ours, but
                yknow. STILLA FUN FACT :P i guess fate loves boat or sum. i mean, who cant love boat?<br><br>
