                hi! i decided, that the regular kat page, and well, even the main "misc" page wouldnt fit the content i
                would like to add here. so what the hell is this place? well, im planning on adding personal
                experiences, lore and other stuff on this page, since i dont think any other page fits.<br><br>to be
                fair though, i still dont know what i will put here, i will jokingly add this part, because i think it
                will be funny, if this said "i dont have any ideas", and by some miracle this page becomes the most
                packed page. that'd be funny innit.<br><br>ok, but genuinely, what will be here? well, personal eras,
                and other shi i deem valuable enough to be here. i highly believe, that this page will look the least
                complete/professional or katpage-like, but thats the way it will be. i kind of tried to aim for a 90s
                page style. so yea.</div>
