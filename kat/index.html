                hi, reader :) i have scrapped the previous site and turned it into a <a
                        href="/kat/cars/index.html">seperate page</a> [cars-related], since that was the main topic
                there either way. ANYHOW! also, full navbar is unlocked here, bcuz if i want to show around, its easier
                than to explain all the easter eggs, so :P
                <br><br>
                <h1>note</h1>
                this page is not like others, and will probably lack some personality, but i do not really care, because
                i dont think i should fit personality into something this serious lmao :(
                <br><br>
                <h1>
                        intro more or les</h1>
                i feel like since the initial release of the website, i kind of dropped a basic introduction, but never
                got deeper into it, but oh well :P i guess here i will put most of the stuff that i want to write about
                myself, or just me-stuff. so, if you are reading this, im already grateful you are taking interest in me
                for some reason :P
                <br><br>
                <h1>about me, fr this time</h1>
                i am 17 yrs old at the time of writing this, i will soon be 18, so if its 2025 oct, i am 18 already!
                Woohoo! happy birthday to me :3 hehe, jokes aside. my life is not that remarkable, and i dont really
                know what to put here, or even, what i could put here, since this is a public website and thats that
                haha. oh well.
                <br><br>
                <h1>before this website, ALSO HI AGAIN</h1>
                before i could even dream of building my own website and having all of this power, i firstly must
                briefly talk about me and computers. tbh, i myself have no idea how i came to use computers, i guess
                when i was little, my dad introduced me to an old laptop that had games and shi, and i started playing
                there.<br><br>eventually, i ended up learning how to use a computer, how to operate apps and keyboards,
                how to use mouse, i learned the basics, eventually i fell in love with a game called minecraft, and i
                wanted to mod it, and had a bunch of funny experiences about me thinking i had to complete some tasks or
                something IN MINECRAFT in order to unlock mods, as if it were some DLC, sadly however, this was false.
                so eventually i employed my dad who knows russian to download mods for me, and he sadly failed and i had
                lost hope of ever modding a game. but then i came across a tutorial to download aether mod, and it
                actually worked [besides me freaking out that my pc froze after installing it... ouch]. and that was my
                first experience with mods, then with time i got my own personal computer [specs n stuff mentioned
                later, probably?] for 800 Euro on the 18th day of September 2019.<br><br>eventually i met some people on
                Discord, and we got to chatting, and at some point, after countless failed interactions and my cringy
                username [MangoModz... damn, rip.] eventually changing to [REDACTED], i met some people that i kind of
                clicked with, and i was pretty close with. at that point, covid was starting to conquer the globe, and
                we were all in lockdown. at some point, as a joke i decided to play around with discord bots and coding,
                and quite quickly realized, that i had no idea what the fuck i was doing.<br><br>at some point, i met a
                certain ginger [who went by Sokoladinis for a while], and got invited to a discord server
                [litva], where i was recruited to create a discord bot for the server, however me being an egoistic mf,
                i took up the offer despite desperately struggling with my previous bot LOL, but somehow, it actually
                worked out very well, and i got the grasp of coding in ctictactoe pretty quickly, and then, something
                had clicked?
                <br><br>
                at a certain point, after having eaten 16 counts of i see creamz [ice cream, ifykyk], i realized, that i
                had a pretty good understanding of it, and enjoyed it a lot, which is surprising, because i always had
                considered myself "EH" at best when it came to coding, and had largely thought it wasnt a me thing. so
                then, i started coding more bots, and over five years, ive made multiple bots that were pretty well
                received and loved, possibly shaping memories for many, which, i am quite proud of.
                <br><br>
                arnd 2021/2022, i met a certain food item named pancake, mf was enlightened with the most fire knowledge
                about coding, and apparently i had become a disciple at some point haha :) [hi btw] and i was lucky
                enough to have been enlightened with basic html/css knowledge, which eventually lead to the creation of
                my first website, which was just anarchy LOL. ANYHOW, the next website was named vafelkis wiki [or
                katwiki], where i documented my own stuff more or less, and it was a project i quite loved, and even the
                "MAIN" pages of this website are directly inspired from the katwiki. at some point, i found out about
                github.io pages, and i ended up creating one, and slowly making my way to where i am now.
