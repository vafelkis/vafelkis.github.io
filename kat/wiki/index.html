                hi! i decided, that the regular kat page, and well, even the main "misc" page wouldnt fit the content i
                would like to add here. so what the hell is this place? well, im planning on adding personal
                experiences, lore and other stuff on this page, since i dont think any other page fits.<br><br>to be
                fair though, i still dont know what i will put here, i will jokingly add this part, because i think it
                will be funny, if this said "i dont have any ideas", and by some miracle this page becomes the most
                packed page. that'd be funny innit.<br><br>ok, but genuinely, what will be here? well, personal eras,
                and other shi i deem valuable enough to be here. i highly believe, that this page will look the least
                complete/professional or katpage-like, but thats the way it will be. i kind of tried to aim for a 90s
                page style. so yea.

                <h1>eurobeat era</h1>
                an era that started actually quite accidentally, it all started when i found and downloaded an old
                playlist i knew existed, and then i decided to go take my license, and well, the cover of the playlist
                was a car, so i listened to it, and then i passed, since then, i guess that playlist was all the hype.
                <a class="sigmahover2" href="kat/lore#eurobeat">[insert katlore's eurobeat shi]</a>. now, however, as of writing in late
                oct, the era is mostly dead and over, i like to say, that the era ended around then, when i passed my b
                cat exam.
                <h1>fight club era</h1>
                the fight club era was around the 20th of dec 2024, when i watched fight club for the first time and
                actually enjoyed it, and the message. having had my mental health destroyed by the previous era, i felt
                horrible and decided to have my own "fight club" bubble, eventually i started yapping about it and its
                messages and the movie itself, because i kind of started to like the philosophy of it and such, and it
                actually became one of the best eras in my life, despite being a bit wanky and all over the place, i
                feel liek i grew as a person, because i read books, found out my limits, became more confident, started
                loving myself just a little bit more. ended due to a stagnation [of the era] and shifting interests. the
                theme song for this is actually <a class="sigmahover2"
