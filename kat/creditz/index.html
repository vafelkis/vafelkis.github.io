                                <div class="main">in a far away land, somewhere very very far away. a small lad was
                                        born. this lad had grown up more or less around a screen that was nothing more
                                        than a few million pixels. truth be told, the childhood of this lad was more or
                                        less one of typical kidz, who loved computers and grew up around those spaces.
                                        <br><br>
                                        in 2022, or was it 2023? i was approached by some food item named pancake, who
                                        eventually taught me basic css. nothing much ever came of it, as i was pretty
                                        lazy and had no ideas at the time. after a bit of brainstorming, i found out
                                        that github pages existed, and eventually one fateful day, on the 15th of
                                        january, 2025. this website was born.<br><br>this website has seen my worst
                                        days, my best days, and, truth be told, its not even been a year of this website
                                        as i'm writing this. it was my first website that i made public, and even
                                        somehow made me learn css in a fun and enjoyable way. it was the first project
                                        that i managed to stick to for prolonged periods of time.
                                </div><br>
                                <div class="red">this site may be just a small spec in the world and the universe as a
                                        whole, and well, who are we to believe that we mean something? we are all just
                                        small beings in the grand scheme of things, but we all have something we love,
                                        dont we? and this was that one thing that made life feel more fulfilling. ill
                                        never forget the days where i used to go to some place in the world, be it
                                        warsaw, palanga, or any other place, and i used to look at my website and be in
                                        awe.<br><br>how could i, a person who never thought he could even be able to do
                                        something like this, build something as beautiful as this? it is truly something
                                        i very proud of, and something i will cherish for the rest of my life
                                        probably.<br><br>i wish to make this a longterm project, and i dont know, update
                                        it until the day either the internet dies, my time runs out, or im married and
                                        living happily ever after, having won the unforgiving game of life.<br><br>as im
                                        writing this, its the year 2025. perhaps these credits will be edited, perhaps
                                        remade, perhaps something else. but christmas has already passed, and its the
                                        last few days of the year. but this is an ode to a year that i was happy. a year
                                        that i was truly happy. i will never forget how happy i was with my ex
                                        gurlfriend [mushroomgurl], who made this site's development even more
                                        enjoyable.<br><br>i will never be 17 again, going on silly dates in the summer,
                                        in the rain, having my special moments with a person i loved. and in a sense,
                                        its beautiful, no? what a joy it is, to have lived through rough moments, and
                                        finally get a breath of air. its also rough, but you cant do much about it, you
                                        suck it up and keep going.<br><br>some things come, some things go. thats just
                                        life.<br><br>thats what i meant by "this website has seen my highs and lows",
                                        cause it really did see everything, when we were talking, i would usually play
                                        around with my website and got argueably the most progress done on any project
                                        ive ever embarked on.
