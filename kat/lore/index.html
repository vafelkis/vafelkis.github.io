                        photoshop, around that time i had also started to go by the alias "katrewkate" in some places. i
                        created this flag as a joke, and purposely made it low quality [however, the one used on this
                        website is a recreated high quality one], and there it was, waffelica. at the time it was
                        actually called <i>united states of vafelkia, united states of cats and pancakes, united states
                                of waffelica</i>, but i mostly referred to it as <i><b

                        for the efect.] ZODZIU, oi, wrong languag. ok, so next up, i forgot. Oh, right. Okay, so, at the
                        time, me and my friends [current katrewkate yt team], and there it was, the first instance of
                        vafelkia.<br><br>first occurence of waffelica was in the katrewkatesmp [2023], where i created a
                        country, and many people moved here, some of the fictional companies/sponsors [e.g. vafducks and
                        vafmarket] originated here, there were no cities, or major landmarks, and while i will add the
                        photos, there isn't much to really discuss. we just had a fun time. <br>[photos]<br> the second
                        time waffelica had an "actual" state, was in a friend's server [2024], where i decided to create
                        a city, and that city was governed by waffelica, and the most major cities were <b>New
                                Archin</b> [a reference to archania in inrl by a friend that i do not know if i can
                        mention], <b>Los Iway</b> [a reference to something i would rather not talk about:D, see penguin
                        empire for more], <b>Los Katinos</b>, <b>Los Ees</b>, and cities like <b>Mellowdale</b> and
                        <b>Karamelcity</b>, which were never completed or even started. [add more photos here]<br>

                        some point, i even made a song about katrewkatesmp, where i bashed brazilians [which were some
                        of the modern day katrewkate yt mates], and how waffelica canonically conquered most of the
                        world, directly or not.<br><br>it was also the first city/server, where road signs were used,
                        besides the basic archanian ones in inrl, while archania had road signs, they were primitive,
                        while the next generation [this one] of road signs were more advanced and interesting. i might
                        add examples soon too.<br>

                        pretty nice atmosphere, i was pretty happy and also spent some great time with my friends.
                        however, most friends left the server and moved on to school after april, and i kept this server
                        alive for around a year, until finally letting go of it and just letting it be autodeleted.

                        </a><br id="archexp">fak diz [will add more l8r] :'D ... so i did. i think? idk, read to find
                        out i guess. anyway, i first created the flag used for the penguin empire [antartica] and
                        archania [my own fictional state] in 2021. at some point during valentine's 2022, i created an
                        anthem for this lmao. i do not remember much about the details, however i used photoshop for it,
                        and it was great, i even bought a flag that had this flag printed on it lmao!<br><br>this flag
                        was barely used up until 2022, when i entered sokoladinis' minecraft server, where i had my own
                        ministate, which at the time had commie symbols and had an altered flag, however, this didn't
                        last for long, and i'm pretty sure, besides a few screenshots, no further uses of this flag were
                        noted, until...<br><br>i decided to create my own server, which was earthsmp around 2022 and
                        contained most of my friends at the time, we played there often, and archania was the "baltic
                        assr", which was controlled by load indirectly, and there was a whole fiasco about that lmao.
                        anyhow, the flag was flown there many times and it was used for the baltic assr as well. [baltic
                        autonomous so**** republic] [censored, because we do not condom comunism.] and
                        then...<br><br>here comes inrl, which was a server run by a certain person i know [that i wont
                        name, probably, for their privacy], here, i was invited randomly after being invited by another
                        friend and i met this dude, then he invited me to inrl, and that's crazy. really crazy. in fact,
                        we went on to create a big minecraft world that contained warships, cities, warzones, i dont
                        know, a lot of stuff lol. you shouldnt ask me. eventually, after being a part of the SCCR i
                        think it was called? idk wat it stands for, but it was the owner's country, i decided to buy my
                        own land for like 50,000 dispay dollers.<br><br>there, nothing interesting truly happened, i had
                        a small patch of land, and i made the most of it, i built an airport [archin airport], created passage ways and
                        stuff, all while watching vice news' documentary on 2014 ukraine... damn. eventually, i rolled
                        out my own passport in the country [rather, a book and quill with plain information and simple
                        formatting lol] alongside basic road signs and it was pretty cool, eventually, i dont even
                        remember how that well,
                        archania expanded past it's small bounds, and spanned across most of the "island", it was built
                        on.<br><br>later, in the canonical sense, i was permitted to annex the owner's rebellious
                        wartorn region named "Erlogovich", which for some reason i did, then came.. i'm not sure lowkey.
                        i just know, that archania expanded onwards, and had a lot of fun buildings and even a full city
                        named <b>Archin</b> [the capital], which is pretty cool. it also had an <b>AWSM</b> unit, which was basically
                        a selfdefense unit, but also spelled awesome lmao. i also had cities like <b>Sulfurpol</b> and
                        <b>Magnopol</b>. While the two latter ones weren't ever fully developed, <b>Archin</b> was developed
                        and pretty sick.<br><br>archania [inrl] grew up until the point of the sponsor logo on the misc
                        page, it was pretty massive, at some point, i had stuff to do, and i ended up mostly abandoning
                        inrl for actual real life. i do not know the fate of my country, i think the owner invited
                        someone else to take over, but im not sure how far they came.<br><br>along with archania were
                        posters, many buildings and so on. we had a meme, where the symbol for my country was "S+", i
                        dont know why, but the plus represented positivity, i guess? i'm not so sure anymore. but it was
                        just that, and it can be spotted on multiple posters. [i might upload em here] anyhow, here are
                        all of the regions that made up archania [or at least those documented]:<ol type="I"

                        to attend to, and shortly thereafter, i had created katrewkatesmp, and the Archanian republic
                        was mostly replaced with the Waffelican republik of wateva. and that's about it. as far as i
                        know, inrl could have continued up until 2024.<br><br>

                   <h4 id="eurointro" style="text-align: left !important; padding: 0 0 0 0; margin: 0 0 0 0;">introduction</h4>idk, i had doubts whether to add this, but i wanted to try out the ideas that aninternetuser0 suggested, and thats that. i know i yap about this quite a lot, but oh well. :D it is what it is.<br><br>anyhow, fake eurobeat [as it is called online for some reason] is actually disco polo, a polish disco genre, that originated in the 80s/90s with elements of western dance music elements [if i got it right].<br><br>usually, love and similar themes are the main ones in the genre. however, in poland, this genre is lowkey looked down upon, and is usually considered too simple or bland, which i personally understand. [but guess who likes vibey music...]
                   <br><br><h4 id="eurocreation" style="text-align: left !important; padding: 0 0 0 0; margin: 0 0 0 0;">my experience, importance</h4>personally, i always liked upbeat music that wasnt too harsh, but also not too soft, and i used to be a listener of phonk, another genre i really love, however, phonk didnt have any influence at the time of this website's creation, so i think eurobeat is more worthy of such a mention, anyhow. i first stumbled upon the 1st fake eurobeat mix during 2022 august, where i really started to like "mig ~ co ty mi dasz".<br><br>for a while after that, i forgot about eurobeat and the mix itself, i didn't like most songs on there, and just moved on. however, at some point around 2025 april, i decided to download the 1st mix again for no reason [check below for the links to the mixes, including the first one], i mean, there was a reason, i wanted to listen to car-related music, and guess what! the genre was not entirely directed at cars, but it fit the car theme pretty well, so i listened to it once or twice since then.<br><br>until.. in may of 2025, i decided to try to take a theory test for a car [license], and guess what, i actually passed after a whole day of listening to eurobeat and grinding the theory test questions lmao. and it was crazy, i passed first try [two times in a row, for a moped and now a car].<br><br>after that, eurobeat slowly grew to become my day-to-day music, as it was vibey, pretty uplifting and just energetic, which at the time, was the vibe! and well, with time, that genre grew to be more than just a genre. why?<br><br>its pretty simple, it was awesome and i loved it, thats about it lmao, but at the time, it lwokey felt like a lot of things went right, and then a few katrewkate beamng videos dropped, where most clips had eurobeat playing in the background, and i guess that added to the vibe and lowkey made me like the genre even more.<br><br>around that time, other events also worked out in my favor, and then i was pretty happy, and guess wat, happy music + happy me = awesomeness. or, for you, not really :/ but to me, yes!!! and i guess i associate eurobeat with "great times", because of the above mentioned events.
                   <br><br><h4 id="euromyexp" style="text-align: left !important; padding: 0 0 0 0; margin: 0 0 0 0;">fate [pesronal]</h4>um, sadly, or not, i think eurobeat [for me] will meet the same fate as all previous genres and songs have. they will remain in my playlist and be remembered for probably the rest of my life at this point, but the songs and mixes will most likely remain there, not being listened to and just kind of abandoned in a sense. dont get me wrong, i love the genre, and i do listen to it still, but "nothing truly lasts forever.", so... yeah:( however, i think i will truly have fond memories of the genre, as it truly helped me be me, and also enjoy life just a bit more.
